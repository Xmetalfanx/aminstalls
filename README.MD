# Xmetal AppImage installer scripts 

## Credits

All the "heavy lifting" goes to [AM](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM#how-to-set-the-path-to-local-apps) and all their contributors... this script I am doing just makes setting that up and installing common apps they have access to, "easier" ... again MOST of the credit should go to them
