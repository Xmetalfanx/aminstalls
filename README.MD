# Xmetal AppImage installer scripts 

## How to use 

- Run am_appimage_installer.sh 

## am_appimage_installer 

### main script

- This contains two options 
  1) Install AM (App Manager)
       - Install AM will install [AM](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM) and help you set it up
  2) Install Apps
        - This loads a menu with different app catagories and gives the user a chance to install them.
          - I was debating this for a little bit, but will leave it as-is for now.  
          - My debate was 
            - "what if a user only wants to install some of these?" ...     
            - "listing each app one by one, would mean a 'never-ending' menu"

## Credits

All the "heavy lifting" goes to [AM](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM#how-to-set-the-path-to-local-apps) and all their contributors... this script I am doing just makes setting that up and installing common apps they have access to, "easier" ... again MOST of the credit should go to them
